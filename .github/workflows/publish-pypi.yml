name: Publish to PyPI

# Automatically publish to PyPI when a GitHub release is created
# This workflow:
# 1. Runs tests on Python 3.11, 3.12, 3.13
# 2. Builds the package
# 3. Publishes to PyPI using Trusted Publishing (OIDC)
# 4. Uploads artifacts to GitHub release
#
# Setup required:
# - Configure PyPI Trusted Publisher at https://pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/
# - See PUBLISHING.md for detailed instructions
